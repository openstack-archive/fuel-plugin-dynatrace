Limitations
-----------

The node with the *Dynatrace Security Gateway* role needs to have network 
access to either the Dynatrace Managed cluster or the Dynatrace SaaS 
endpoint. Furthermore, if you want to monitor your applications that run on
top of OpenStack as well, you need to install the *Dynatrace OneAgent* in
your workloads and you need to make sure, that the *Dynatrace OneAgent* has
network access to the node with the *Dynatrace Security Gateway* role.
