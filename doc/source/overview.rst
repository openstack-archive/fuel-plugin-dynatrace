Overview
--------
The Dynatrace Fuel plugin introduces a new node role called *Dynatrace*.
During the deployment the Dynatrace agent will be installed on all
*Dynatrace* nodes. In the settings you can specify the information that the
agent needs to work properly. After a successful deployment the Dynatrace
agent should be running on all *Dynatrace* hosts.
